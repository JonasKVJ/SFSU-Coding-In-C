# SFSU-Coding-In-C
Fundamental coding assignments in C, completed at San Francisco State University as part of a class on operating systems. 
If reading these to assert my skill level, the best place to start would be assignment 4 or 5. If intending to run the programs on an OS other than Ubuntu 16.04, assignment 3 would be the best candidate. 

Overview:
- Assignment 1: Hello World
- Assignment 2: Build a basic shell 
- Assignment 3: Use a multithreaded program to count letters in a .txt file. Uses mutexes to prevent race conditions 
- Assignment 4: Compare a multithreaded program with and without mutexes
- Assignment 5: Producer consumer problem solved by using semaphores, which only runs on Ubuntu (tested in VirtualBox)
- Assignment 6: Write your own 'cp' command by using read(), write(), open() and close().
